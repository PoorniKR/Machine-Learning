## Introduction

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. It is used to build models that can identify patterns and make predictions on unseen data.

## Key Concepts

### Supervised Learning
- **Definition**: Learning from labeled data. The model is trained on a dataset where the correct output (label) is provided.
- **Examples**: Classification (e.g., spam detection), Regression (e.g., predicting house prices).

### Unsupervised Learning
- **Definition**: Learning from data without labels. The model tries to find hidden patterns or relationships in the data.
- **Examples**: Clustering (e.g., customer segmentation), Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., PCA).

### Reinforcement Learning
- **Definition**: Learning through interactions with an environment. The model receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties to make better decisions.
- **Examples**: Game playing, Robotics, Self-driving cars.

## Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Gather and prepare the data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, normalize, and transform the data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Select or create meaningful features for the model.
4. **Model Training**: Train the machine learning model using a suitable algorithm.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics.
6. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the model for real-world use.
7. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor and improve the model's performance.
